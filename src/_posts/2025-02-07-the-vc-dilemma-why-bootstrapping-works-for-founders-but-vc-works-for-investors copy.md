I’ve been a bootstrapped founder for over 20 years. I’ve built 3 successful companies and many more failures. But I’ve managed to make a living and maintain control over my own destiny—all without raising any investor capital.

Recently, I explored the VC path with Rose City Robotics. I had conversations, customer discovery, pitch competitions, and weighed the pros and cons, and ultimately decided that venture capital wasn’t the right fit for me.

While I’ve chosen to stay bootstrapped, I now also have the opportunity to invest as a VC, which is a completely different game—one where I can spread risk across multiple companies and benefit from others’ success rather than shouldering all the risk myself. That’s the fundamental dichotomy of VC: it’s a great system for investors, but honestly not a great one for founders. Yes, it’s possible to make a huge, life-changing exit, but do most founders really make money when exiting after raising VC funding? I have my doubts.

Beyond that, I care deeply about open source software, social entrepreneurship, open startups, and public benefit companies. My goal has always been to build businesses that align with these values—focusing on impact, transparency, and sustainability rather than just maximizing shareholder returns. Here’s why I chose to stay on the founder side and not raise VC money:

## Control Matters

Raising VC money means giving up control—often in ways that go beyond just equity. Investors expect board seats, which means they have a direct say in the company’s decisions and can literally fire you. While that works for some founders, I realized I didn’t want to hand over decision-making power to people whose primary focus is maximizing returns rather than the long-term mission of the company.

## Managing Investors Becomes a Full-Time Job

I know multiple founders whose primary job isn’t running their company—it’s managing investors. Board meetings, investor updates, navigating expectations, personalities and drama, as well as creating supporting research to constantly justify every move will inevitably take up a massive chunk of their time.

I’d much rather spend my energy building the business, working with customers, and improving our technology.

## The $1 Billion or Bust Mentality

VCs aren’t happy unless you’re on track for a billion-dollar valuation. Anything less is a failure. Full stop. That kind of pressure leads to aggressive growth tactics, often pushing companies to take massive risks that might not be in their best long-term interest—or at the very least, undue pressure and the disappointment of being a “failure” even if you are generating millions in cash flow.

## Forced Growth Can Kill a Business

Venture capitalists want to maximize returns in a short timeframe. If that means pivoting, making risky bets, or sacrificing profitability for hypergrowth, so be it. But as a founder, I want to build something sustainable—something that can succeed on its own terms, not just as an attractive acquisition target. VC pressure will likely cause you to take risks to get to that $1B valuation which could end your business.

## Your Mission No Longer Belongs to You

When you take venture funding, your company’s mission can shift—sometimes drastically. Right now I have full control of the mission and what I want to be doing on a day-to-day basis, decided between myself and my co-founder.

Investors have the power to push for changes that align with their financial goals but might not align with the values and vision you started with. If I’m building a company, I want to do it on my terms, not based on what a VC firm thinks will get the highest multiple.

## Bootstrapping = Freedom

At the end of the day, bootstrapping gives me freedom. I don’t have to answer to investors. I don’t have to chase unrealistic growth targets. I don’t have to risk the soul of my business for someone else’s payday. Instead, I can focus on building a company that makes an impact, serves customers, and grows in a way that makes sense. **No investors = no bullshit.**

For some founders, VC is the right path. But for me? I’d rather own my destiny, control my company, and build something sustainable. That’s why I’ve bootstrapped for 20+ years—and why I plan to keep it that way.

## Investing as a VC Is a Different Story

That said, I’ve been fortunate to have multiple exits and now have the capital to invest. Being an investor is a completely different game. Unlike founders, as an investor I can diversify across multiple companies, spreading risk instead of putting everything into one venture. I also get the opportunity to benefit from someone else’s hard work and success—imagine that: an investor who makes money off someone else’s hard work!

## The VC Dilemma: Good for Investors, Tough for Founders

The irony of venture capital is that what makes it great for investors is exactly what makes it difficult for founders. As an investor, I can build a diversified portfolio, knowing that only a few of my bets need to succeed for me to see returns. But for the founder, everything rides on that one company. There’s no safety net, no portfolio effect—just a relentless push for success or failure.

I would love to see real data on how much the average founder actually makes from a VC-backed exit. The big $1B unicorn stories skew perception, but the reality is likely far less glamorous. Many founders walk away with little to nothing after years of grinding, often taking below-market salaries while investors still capture returns from the portfolio effect. When a startup fails, VCs move on to their next bet—but the founder is left with nothing but lost time and experience.

VCs push for aggressive growth because they can afford to. If one company flames out, they have nine more in their portfolio to back up their fund. But the founder? They only get one shot. They have to risk it all—time, energy, reputation, and sometimes even their personal finances—to make it work.

That’s why the incentives between founders and investors don’t always align. What’s best for the fund isn’t always best for the entrepreneur. As someone who has lived both sides, I understand this duality firsthand. I respect the founders who take the VC path, and I respect the investors who back them—but I also recognize that the system is designed to favor the investor, not the founder.

I’m pretty sure my returns as a bootstrapped founder exceed the average expected return of a VC founder over the same time horizon.

In the end, I prefer the autonomy of bootstrapping. But as an investor, I appreciate the strategic advantage of spreading risk. It’s a paradox I’ll continue to navigate—balancing my respect for the grind of founders with the reality that investing offers a more diversified path to success.
