Venture capital is glamorized. Startup competitions, pitch decks, cash prizes, investment.

Founders are celebrated for raising millions before building anything real. But what if getting VC money early is more curse than blessing?

The Certified Financial Planner Board has said nearly 33% of lottery winners file for bankruptcy within three to five years.

I know a founder who’s been a multimillionaire ten times over on paper—net worth north of eight figures in good years. But when his core business had an off year he felt poor.

Net worth ≠ groceries. **Cash flow is king** in life and in business.

## Customer Money vs. Investor Money

There are two ways to start a business:

**Customer Validation:** Get a real human to give you money for solving a real problem.

**Investor Validation:** Convince someone to bet on your idea before it's proven. Then get customer validation.

They are not the same. One leads to a sustainable business. The other often leads to inflated expectations, misaligned incentives, and premature scaling.

## The Danger of Investor Validation

When a founder gets validation from an investor, they often stop seeking it from customers. Money in the bank feels like traction—but it isn't. You can buy ads, hire staff, polish marketing. But you can't buy product-market fit.

VCs optimize for 100x returns. That means pushing for speed and scale—sometimes before the foundation is ready. If you're not growing fast enough, you'll be cut off, pivoted, or replaced.

This is venture capital by definition: **extractive capital** it harvests your growth on a fund’s schedule. The game is startup hot potato: pass the company fast enough to land an acquisition or IPO before the music stops. Place ten bets and maybe one of them will hit. Its not evil, its math. But the math sucks for nine out of ten founders.

## "Fuel on Fire" Only Works If There's a Fire

VC money is fuel. It makes things go faster. But if you don't have a working engine, you're just burning cash. Many startups mistake capital for progress. They chase growth before understanding their customer. They hire too quickly, scale too early, and collapse under their own weight.

Meanwhile, the VC will eventually catch on that there's no real fire without the artificial fuel. The fund simply pours the next can elsewhere.

## Bootstrapping Builds Muscle

Starting with customer revenue forces you to build something people actually want. It makes you scrappy. It demands discipline. Bootstrapped companies often grow slower—but they grow smarter. They learn to sell, to build, to iterate. They don't rely on someone else's checkbook to survive.

## When VC Makes Sense

VC can be a useful tool—if you control the relationship:

- You have a product with traction and want to scale.
- You understand the terms, tradeoffs, ownership, control, and timelines.
- You're building something capital-intensive that can't be bootstrapped.

But as a starting point? It's often a distraction from the real work and provides false signal and validation.

## Closing Thought

Venture capital needs founders to survive, but founders don't need VC to start. Get customer money first. Build strength. Then, if needed, bring in VC to turn a small fire into a bonfire. But only when you're strong enough to maintain board control.

Don't win the startup lottery. Win the customer and cash flow engine.
