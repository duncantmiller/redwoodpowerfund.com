Last week, we won our first pitch competition at [Demolicious](https://www.pitchatdemolicious.com/). Winning Demolicious is not just about taking home a belt, it's about being part of Portland’s thriving startup ecosystem. The competition fosters an incredible sense of community, where early-stage teams can network, share ideas, and gain valuable feedback from fellow entrepreneurs. For us at Rose City Robotics, it was an opportunity to not only showcase our company but also see the exciting projects other teams are working on.

Demolicious is hosted monthly in Portland Oregon, organized by Rick Turoczy and Upstart Collective's Josh Carter. Teams get just 3 minutes to pitch their idea with slides.

Our win was particularly sweet after dethroning the amazing 3-time winner [Airbuild](https://www.airbuildinc.com/) lead by David Gory, a team that has dominated the competition for months. While Airbuild couldn't make it in person this time, we know they’ll be bringing their A-game to the finals. We’d also like to extend our appreciation to the other six teams that participated. Each pitch showcased the creativity and ambition that Portland’s startup community is known for. We look forward to seeing you again!

We got to take home the infamous Demolicious belt and have added our Rose City Robotics Sticker.

Securing the Demolicious belt is an exciting milestone, but this journey is just beginning. The next challenge will be defending our title at the October 24th event, and ultimately, facing off against the best of the best in December at the "Champion of Champions" competition.

So, if you’re in Portland on October 24th, [come cheer us on](https://www.meetup.com/demolicious-portland/events/303009463/) as we defend our title! And be sure to mark your calendars for December 10th, where we’ll take the stage at the historic McMenamins Mission Theater for the ultimate showdown at the [Demolicious Champion of Champions](https://www.meetup.com/demolicious-portland/events/301736791). It’s going to be an epic night, and we’d love to have your support as we battle for the 2024 Demolicious Champion title!

The Champion of Champions will get this sweet belt made by the same company that makes the official WWF belts (they are leaning into the wrestling theme here if you haven't caught on yet). Wish us luck and come support our pitch!
